# Privacy Policy — Valnet Social Insights Pipeline (TikTok)
 
**Effective date:** August 13, 2026
**Last updated:** August 13, 2026
 
## 1. Introduction
 
This Privacy Policy describes how Valnet Inc. ("Valnet," "we," "us," or "our") handles data accessed through our internal social media analytics application (the "Application") in connection with the TikTok Developer APIs, including the TikTok Display API and the TikTok API for Business. The Application retrieves performance data for TikTok accounts that are owned and operated by Valnet, for the sole purpose of internal analytics and reporting.
 
This policy applies to the Application's use of TikTok's developer platform and explains what data we access, how we use it, how we store and protect it, and how to contact us.
 
## 2. Scope
 
The Application accesses data exclusively for TikTok accounts owned by Valnet (for example, our brand accounts such as ScreenRant and CBR). The Application does not access, collect, or process data belonging to other businesses, third-party creators, or individual consumers/end users. It does not offer a login, does not onboard external users, and is not made available to the public.
 
Authorization is granted by Valnet's own account administrators through TikTok's OAuth flow, and the resulting access tokens are used solely to read data for those Valnet-owned accounts.
 
## 3. Information We Access
 
Through the TikTok Display API and the TikTok API for Business, using authorized access tokens for Valnet-owned accounts, the Application accesses:
 
- **Video-level insights** for our TikTok content — for example views, likes, comments, shares, watch time, average watch time, reach, and derived engagement rates.
- **Account-level insights** for our TikTok accounts — for example profile views, follower counts, follower growth, and aggregate audience data made available by TikTok.
- **Video metadata** — video identifiers, publish timestamps (`create_time`), titles and descriptions, durations, and share/embed links for our own content.
The scopes requested are limited to what is necessary for this reporting (for example `user.info.basic`, `user.info.profile`, `user.info.stats`, and `video.list`). The Application does not request or use content-publishing scopes, data-portability scopes, or research scopes.
 
The Application accesses aggregate and content-level metrics about Valnet's own accounts and videos. It does not collect the personal information of individual users who view, follow, like, or comment on our content, and it does not access direct messages, contact lists, or the profile data of other TikTok users.
 
## 4. How We Use the Information
 
We use the accessed data only for internal business purposes, including:
 
- Measuring and reporting on the performance of our own published content;
- Understanding audience engagement trends across our brands;
- Comparing performance across our own platforms and brand accounts; and
- Internal business intelligence and editorial decision-making.
We do not use this data for advertising to individuals, we do not sell it, we do not use it to build profiles of individual consumers, and we do not use it to train machine learning or AI models.
 
## 5. How We Store and Protect the Information
 
Data retrieved by the Application is stored in Valnet's private Google Cloud Platform environment (Google BigQuery), hosted in Canada. Access controls include:
 
- Storage within a private, access-controlled Google Cloud project restricted to authorized Valnet personnel;
- Authentication to TikTok's APIs via securely stored client credentials and access/refresh tokens held in a managed secret store (never hardcoded or shared publicly);
- Encryption of data in transit and at rest as provided by Google Cloud Platform; and
- Access limited to Valnet employees and contractors with a legitimate business need.
Time-limited assets provided by TikTok — such as cover image URLs, which TikTok serves with a short time-to-live — are not permanently cached or re-hosted; where an image reference is stored, it is stored as a reference only and refreshed from TikTok when needed.
 
## 6. Data Sharing
 
We do not share, sell, rent, or otherwise disclose TikTok data to third parties. Data is used only by authorized Valnet personnel and our infrastructure service providers (e.g. Google Cloud Platform) that process data on our behalf under their own security and privacy commitments.
 
## 7. Data Retention and Deletion
 
We retain detailed historical metrics for internal reporting for as long as they are needed for the purposes described above. Certain reporting tables retain only a rolling recent window (approximately 30 days), while historical archives may be kept longer for trend analysis.
 
If a video is deleted or made private on TikTok, or if a Valnet account revokes the Application's authorization, we cease retrieving data for that content and remove the associated records from our active reporting tables on our next scheduled refresh.
 
Because the Application processes data only for Valnet-owned TikTok accounts and does not store personal data about individual end users, deletion requests are handled at the account level. To request deletion of data associated with a Valnet TikTok account accessed by this Application, or to revoke the Application's access, contact us using the details below. Access can also be revoked at any time from within the TikTok app or TikTok Business Center by removing the Application's authorization.
 
## 8. Compliance with TikTok Developer Terms
 
The Application's use of information received from TikTok's developer platform adheres to the [TikTok Developer Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/tik-tok-developer-terms-of-service/en) and the [TikTok Developer Guidelines](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/our-guidelines-developer-guidelines), including applicable data use, retention, and deletion requirements. Our use and transfer of information received from TikTok APIs will comply with those terms.
 
## 9. Changes to This Policy
 
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date above.
